===== EnhancedChatApiController Fix Report =====

The following changes have been made to fix the errors in EnhancedChatApiController.php:

1. Added missing import:
   - Added 'use InvalidArgumentException;'

2. Fixed method calls:
   - Replaced all instances of 'sendError()' with 'sendErrorResponse()'
   - Added proper return statements after sendErrorResponse() calls

3. Added missing methods:
   - Added 'validateAuth()' method to authenticate API requests
   - Added 'validateRequiredParams()' method to validate required request parameters

These changes ensure compatibility with BaseApiController and follow the same pattern used in AuthApiController.
